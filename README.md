What went well about this project, what was a challenge, and what would have made it better, and what you would do with more time to work.

What went well:
I am happy that I was able to incorporate the teachers and make all the options easy to access by using loops. 

Challenge: Having the dblocks in a separate dictionary from the Mods. And printing the dates along with the final schedule.

With more time, I would’ve provided options for classes and made them non-repeatable.
